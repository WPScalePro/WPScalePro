## Selective Full Page Cache

This feature allows you to serve fully cached static pages on specific routes of your website.

For example, if your website is: https://abc.com/  
and you want to serve a static version of the `/about-us` page:

1. Create the following directory structure:

   abc.com/about-us/

2. Inside that directory, add a file named:

   index.html

The full path will be:

   abc.com/about-us/index.html

When a request is made to https://abc.com/about-us, this static file will be served directly — bypassing PHP or WordPress.

---

You can also use this feature to serve static files like:

- robots.txt → abc.com/robots.txt
- .well-known directory → abc.com/.well-known/
- Any other static asset you want to serve directly
